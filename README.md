# Scally CSS framework website

A website for the [Scally CSS framework](https://github.com/chris-pearce/scally).
Built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and
hosted with GitHub Pages via the `gh-pages` branch.

The `master` branch is the source code for the site i.e. the uncompiled
Jekyll site. The `gh-pages` branch is the compiled source code and can be
reached on this domain: <http://scally.chris-pearce.me>.

To use the site locally `cd` to where you want to install the website and do
a `git clone`. Then `cd` into the `scally-website` dir, then in the Terminal
type `grunt` which will run the default Grunt tasks including launching the
website in your browser on `localhost:9000`.

If you find any problems with the site or would like to offer any suggestions
for improvements please submit [an issue](https://github.com/chris-pearce/scally-website/issues).
